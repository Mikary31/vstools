The Qt Visual Studio Add-In version 1.1.10 contains multiple bugfixes and
improvements.

Changes
-------
- Be aware of comments when parsing qmake.conf. (QTVSADDINBUG-76)
- Fixed exception when using using unsupported lupdate parameters.
  (QTVSADDINGBUG-70)
- Detecting the MSVC version from qmake.conf was fixed.
- Added QtScriptTools and QtUiTools to project settings. (QTVSADDINBUG-71)
- Removed the MSC version check when adding Qt versions.
  As this "feature" seems to cause more trouble than it solves, we
  decided to remove it. Checking for the makefile generator should at
  least prevent people from trying to add MinGW builds.
- Fixed creation of addin projects from 64 bit Qt qmake projects.
- Do not add the include path "$QTDIR/include/qtmain".
  This path is a relict and confuses IntelliSense. (QTVSADDINBUG-81)
- Be aware of strings when looking for Q_OBJECT macros. (QTVSADDINBUG-75)
