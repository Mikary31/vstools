The Qt Visual Studio Add-In version 1.1.1 contains multiple bugfixes and
improvements.

Changes
-------
- Fixed startup of Qt Designer and Qt Linguist when the application was
  not build for the current project's Qt Version. The Add-In tries to find
  the needed tool inside the directory of the other registered Qt Versions.
- "Generate basic pro file" gets disabled in project's context menu and Qt
  menu if the current project is a qmake generated project.
- When importing a solution file while a solution is opened, the user gets
  the possibility to automatically close the current solution.
- Avoid infinite recursion in inclusion which happened when moccing .cpp
  files, which used precompiled headers.
- Translation files are added when exporting project to a .pri file.
- Project is cleaned, when its Qt version is changed.
- As there is no way to avoid the expansion of generated files filter when
  the project is built the first time, the generated files are collapsed
  after the build has finished (QTBUG-4750).
- Changing the project's Qt Version after importing a .pro file does not
  longer make the build fail (QTBUG-4756)
- Exclusion of .cpp and .h files cause the mocced files to be excluded from
  build too (QTBUG-3404)
- Adding a Qt class no longer implies that precompiled headers are used.
- Fixed processing of lupdate in projects with a big amount of files
  (QTBUG-4783).
