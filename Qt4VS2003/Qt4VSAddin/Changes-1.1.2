The Qt Visual Studio Add-In version 1.1.2 contains multiple bugfixes and
improvements.

Changes
-------
- Fixed various problems concerning precompiled headers (stdafx as default
  (QTBUG-5226), change of settings when building...)
- Increased support for solution folders (QTBUG-4914)
- Detection of solution .pro files fixed (be aware of possible newline
  after \)
- Fixed bug, which could appear when moc steps had to be updated.
  The update caused an invalid moc commandline which made the build fail.
- Added support for Q_Gadget macro(QTBUG-5291)
- Project tree is not expanded on every build when using VS2005 (QTBUG-5291)
- Fixed conversion from AddIn project to Qmake project and vice
  versa (QTBUG5380)
- Repair moc path when importing .pro file (QTBUG-4221)
- Support of commandline builds (QTBUG-5321)
  (In VS2005 there are some issues when trying to load AddIns from the
  commandline. See http://support.microsoft.com/kb/934517)
