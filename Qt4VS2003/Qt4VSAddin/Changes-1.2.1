The Qt Visual Studio Add-In version 1.2.1 contains multiple bugfixes and
improvements.

Changes
-------
- Qt 5.0.1 help documents included
- Qmake wrapper COM component removed and replaced with command line tool
  qmakefilereader to avoid need to load Qt5 library binaries to Visual Studio
  process. And to get installation of add-in easier, especially with VS2008.
- Qt4 add-in is not allowed to run same time, if found it will be closed.
  Also if Qt4 add-in is present in system, default editor values for .ts, .ui
  and .qrc file types are not permanently overwritten by Qt5 add-in. Values are
  written when Qt5 add-in loads and Qt4 values are set when Qt5 add-in unloads.
  This should make it possible to install and use both Qt4 and Qt5 versions of
  add-in. Not to use same time but in turns. Though user must be careful what he
  does.
- Recognizing Qt5 CE build. (QTVSADDINBUG-153)
- Incorrect additional directories paths set when Qt modules added/removed from
  Qt Project Settings page. (QTVSADDINBUG-151)
- Include directories search path for some Qt modules fixed (QTVSADDINBUG-150)
- Invalid Qt module names fixed (QTVSADDINBUG-142)
- Crash when importing .pri file fixed (QTVSADDINBUG-139)
- Qt default settings saving problem fixed (QTVSADDINBUG-137)
- Naming of precompiled header fixed (QTVSADDINBUG-132)
- Support for debugger visualizers in VS2012 (QTVSADDINBUG-129)
