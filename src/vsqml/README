== Static build of Qt

This project requires an x86 static build of Qt that includes at least qtbase and qtdeclarative.

By default, it will look for the Qt build three levels higher in the file system hierarchy, in
"build\qt5-x86-<VS Version>-static", where <VS Version> is one of "vs2017", "vs2015" or "vs2013".

For example, when building in Visual Studio 2015, if the Qt VS Tools solution is located in
X:\dev\vstools (and therefore vsqml is located in X:\dev\vstools\src\vsqml), the project will look
for the static build of Qt in X:\dev\build\qt5-x86-vs2015-static.

It is also possible to override the default Qt build location by setting the following environment
variables:
    QTBUILD_STATIC_VS2017 = <path to x86 static build of Qt for Visual Studio 2017>
    QTBUILD_STATIC_VS2015 = <path to x86 static build of Qt for Visual Studio 2015>
    QTBUILD_STATIC_VS2013 = <path to x86 static build of Qt for Visual Studio 2013>


== Project output

The output DLL is copied to a bin sub-folder inside the project directory
(e.g. X:\dev\vstools\vsqml\bin). This is the location where the VS Tools project will look for it.
